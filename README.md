## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jafagervik/TDT4113-KEYPAD/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
git pull **Fetch latest changes on branch**
git push **Upload your changes to remote branch**
git commit -m <message> **Commit changes for several files and add a message on what you changed/added**
git checkout -b <branchname> **Create new branch locally**
git push --set-upstream origin <branchname>  **Set up branch remotely for others to checkout**
git add <file> **Add files you want to commit and push**
git status **Status on which files has been added/removed/modified**
git checkout <branchname>  **switch branch**
git branch -a              **see all branches**

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jafagervik/TDT4113-KEYPAD/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
